                Bill: Okay, Ted, George Washington. One: the father of our country.
                Ted: Two: born on President's Day.
                Bill: Three: the dollar-bill guy.
                Ted: Bill, you ever made a mushroom out of his head? It's like, just like...
                Bill: Ted. Alaska.
                Ted: Okay. Um... Had wooden teeth, chased Moby Dick.
                Bill: That's Captain Ahab, dude.

                Bill: Ted, while I agree that, in time, our band will be most triumphant. The truth is, Wyld Stallyns will never be a super band until we have Eddie Van Halen on guitar.
                Ted: Yes, Bill. But, I do not believe we will get Eddie Van Halen until we have a triumphant video.
                Bill: Ted, it's pointless to have a triumphant video before we even have decent instruments.
                Ted: Well, how can we have decent instruments when we don't really even know how to play?
                Bill: That is why we NEED Eddie Van Halen!
                Ted: And THAT is why we need a triumphant video.
                Bill, Ted: EXCELLENT!
                [air guitar, the clock chimes 8:00 am]
                Bill: Uh oh, we're late!
                Ted: For what?
                Bill: For school, dude!
                Ted: Oh yeah.

                Hi, welcome to the future. San Dimas, California, 2688. And I'm telling you it's great here.
                The air is clean, the water's clean, even the dirt, it's clean. Bowling averages are way up,
                 mini-golf scores are way down. And we have more excellent water slides than any other planet we
                 communicate with. I'm telling you this place is great! But it almost wasn't. You see, 700 years ago,
                 the two great ones, ran into a few problems. So now I have to travel back in time to help them out.
                 If I should fail to keep these two on the correct path, the basis of our society will be in danger.
                 Don't worry, it'll all make sense. I'm a professional.
               </p>

            <p>Bill: Ted?
              Ted: I'm in love, dude.
              Bill: Whoa. Those must be the princesses you told yourself about at the Circle-K. We gotta go. It's a history report, not a babe report.
              Ted: But, Bill, those are historical babes.
              Bill: Okay, you're the ladies' man. How we gonna meet 'em?
